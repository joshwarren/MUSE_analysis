# MUSE_analysis
Counterpart to VIMOS_analysis. 
Much of the code will be identical, but were never-the-less be duplicated initially due to the slight differences in the datacubes. Since the about beginning of 2017, I have made efforts to reduce the quantity of duplication, thus some code in this repo has dependencies in VIMOS_project. 

Most of the IDL codes (.pro) are now redundant, having been replaced by python counterparts, but are retained for reference.
